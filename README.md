# DidIt CLI Client

A simple iDoneThis command line client that can post dones for you. To configure, you need your API token.

Call as `./didit.rb`.

The client will continue asking you for done entries until you simply hit enter.

This client is written in Ruby and serves as a quick example on how one could use the iDoneThis API.
